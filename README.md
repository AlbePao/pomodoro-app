# Pomodoro App
A simple Apache Cordova application for the Pomodoro Technique to test [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) and [Framework7 CLI](http://framework7.io/cli/) functionality.

## Getting started
Make sure you have installed Cordova CLI and Framework7 CLI:
```
npm install -g cordova
npm install -g framework7-cli
```

Then clone this repository, `cd` in project root and install dependencies:
```
cd pomodoro-app
npm i
```

## NPM Scripts
* `npm run prepare` - prepares Cordova project generating assets and installing required plugins
* `npm start` - run development server
* `npm run build-prod` - build web app for production
* `npm run build-dev` - build web app using development mode (faster build without minification and optimization)
* `npm run build-cordova-prod` - build cordova's `www` folder from and build cordova app
* `npm run build-cordova-dev` - build cordova's `www` folder from and build cordova app using development mode (faster build without minification and optimization)
* `npm run build-cordova-ios-prod` - build cordova's `www` folder from and build cordova iOS app
* `npm run build-cordova-ios-dev` - build cordova's `www` folder from and build cordova iOS app using development mode (faster build without minification and optimization)
* `npm run build-cordova-android-prod` - build cordova's `www` folder from and build cordova Android app
* `npm run build-cordova-android-dev` - build cordova's `www` folder from and build cordova Android app using development mode (faster build without minification and optimization)
* `npm run lint` - lint codebase in `src` directory

## Cordova
Cordova project is located in `cordova` folder. Don't modify contents of this directory. Its content will be correctly generated when `npm run prepare` is called.
Contents of `cordova/www` directory will be generated by `npm run build-cordova-prod` command.

To run Cordova related commands run the following command in the project root directory:
```
framework7 cordova [..args]
```
For example:
```
framework7 cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-statusbar
framework7 cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-splashscreen
framework7 cordova build ios
...
```

## Assets
Assets (icons, splash screens) source images are located in `assets-src` folder.

To generate new icons and splash screen images, you will need to replace all assets in this directory with your own images (pay attention to image size and format), and run the following command in the project directory:

```
framework7 generate-assets
```

Or launch UI where you will be able to change icons and splash screens:

```
framework7 generate-assets --ui
```
